init.sqf call to respawn_init.sqf

--BUGS--
- ACRE2 - call to set spectator false didn't work 1/10 I suspect because unit was transmitted just yet.
- SOMEONE LEAVES WHILST BEING SELECTED and AI IS THEN IN SELECTED bit. Need to have the menus refresh in realtime.
- 1024*768 <- check that the GUI works.
- ACRE2 remove the setspectator the client Init already does this.

- Spectator options - to disable displaying of AI?, limit third person zoomoutage and freecam?
   
LIMITATIONS
- New groups are made and group variable pointers remain. This may lead to the group limit being reached. Arma engine group limiation is 144?
- Player slots do get consumed on playerDeath so it may be worth having extra slots if the intention is people to join.
- Requires the vanilla F3 spectator component.
- GroupMarkers/Briefing and other components are usually disabled in init.sqf, and do not use a variable to track if they have been enabled therefor the assumption is that they have been enabled.
- Only designed for MP and the spawning of players, AI are not supported.
   
PLANNED FEATURES
- Function to respawn player with Pos X etc.

- Spectator - Limit spectator options (no freecam/max zoomout distance) <- Insurgency game style
- Track player data: number of respawns? what team they came from before?
- CODE TIDY UP (F3/Functionize)
- Integration into F3 (admin page/spectator script).
   
KNOWN BUGS.
- Textbox is changed when spectator is changed 'spectating: ...', the ids are different not too sure on this one. 
- Possible issues with concurrency if two admins attempt to spawn groups at the same time.

---------
Race conditions - with Group markers getting called bfore setGroup ID.


=======================
NOTES ON SETTING UP - RESPAWN LOCATIONS
=============
They must follow the pattern of f3_respawnPoint1, if you want to spawn them on the Sea not the elevation box for a game logic will be elevation from the bottom of the sea (ground) and not sea level!
